To install this run the install.sh script as root. It will place the main fluxStyle
executable in /usr/local/bin It will also make a dir in /usr/local/fluxStyle for all the 
files that fluxStyle uses. fluxStyle depends on libglade, and pygtk 2.4 or newer
2.6+ is reccomended. fluxStyle looks only in the users ~/.fluxbox/styles folder for
styles, this is also the only place that it will install a style to at this time. A
'preview.jpg' in the ~/.fluxbox/styles/yourStyle/preview.jpg is required or you will
get the default 'none' showing that informs you what to do to get a preview.  Several
style makers are creating compliant styles. http://tenr.de/ is one, and the famous
fluxbox-styles-fluxmod is another, I have the package with preview images up for
download at: http://errr-online.com/fluxbox/ If you have any problems using this app
please feel free to let me know how I can make it eaiser to use. email:
errr(at)errr-online(dot)com or see me in IRC on irc.freenode.net in #fluxbox.
